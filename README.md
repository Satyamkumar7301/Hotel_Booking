## **Business Problem**
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancelation rates. Each hotel 
is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less 
than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotelsâ€™ 
primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to 
offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
 The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing 
on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.
